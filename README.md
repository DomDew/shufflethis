# README

Hey! Welcome to the repo of the hottest spotify shuffle algorithm you didn't even know you needed: www.shufflethis.xyz

Feel free to mess around with the code if you feel like it, I tried to document it as best as I could (I promise).

This is a rails app, so it comes with all the good stuff that rails provides.
Just make sure to run 'bundle' to install all the gems that shufflethis relies on.

Have fun!
